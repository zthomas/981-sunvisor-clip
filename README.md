Porsche 981 sunvisor clip

Fits 2012-2016 Porsche 981 boxster and cayman models. 

[Gaudin Porsche](https://www.gaudinporscheparts.com/v-2013-porsche-boxster--base--2-7l-h6-gas/body--interior-trim-roof) sells the full visor for around $300USD but doesn't sell the clip separately. 

It's designed to be easily 3D printed on FDM printers when placed on the side. It has a flattened side profile with minimal overhangs. Printing it on the side also aligns the grain orientation to provide improve structural integrity.
